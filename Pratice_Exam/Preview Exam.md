### Scenario
Trump just won the presidential election in the USA, he moves into the white house. Just for him to realize that Hillary Clintons old e-mail server is still running in the basement. This is a big security issue, and needs to be fixed as soon as possible. The server is old, its not possible to upgrade the email software, and it needs to be protected as the Epstein and Diddys guest list on this server.

Trump has heard about this "cloud" thing, and he is adamant in saying it needs to be moved to the cloud. And he wants it done tomorrow!

### Theoretical Tasks
- What kind of migration strategy should be used based on the scenario?
- What kind of services will be used, what are the responsibility of Trump and what is the responsibility of the cloud provider? What are the hosting options available.
- What are the benefits and negative about using the cloud?
- The e-mail server is vulnerable to XSS and SQLi, how can it be protected?

### Practical Task
- Simulate a vulnerable VM in your chosen cloud provider.
- The VM is vulnerable, protect it with a L7 Firewall, also called a WAF(Web Application Firewall)
- Use a Vulnerability Analysis Tool integrated with your tooling or provider, follow up on findings and write a report.
- Investigate the logs generated during your activities within the cloud provider, explain how these can be integrated with a SIEM tool and how this can be helpful from a security and or incident handling perspective.
